      "I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lackof any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an endto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, theyare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you whyhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lotfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot offun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the finalregular season game.          PENS RULE!!!\n",
